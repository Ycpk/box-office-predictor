https://opencagedata.com/api 
API Keys and their files:
1) Youtube Data API 
Follow instructions from Appendix A and create OAuth credentials.
These are not needed to be copied in config.py file as they reside in separate file.
                             2) Twitter API
                                  After signing up locate and copy the credentials consumer key, consumer secret,access token key,access token secret into appropriate placeholders in config.py
		3) MovieDB API key  
                                  Paste the api key in placeholder of config.py
                             4) Opencage API key
                                  Paste the api key in placeholder of config.py
      4.  Starting the webapp.
                             1) After all above steps are completed , open terminal/cmd in root folder of the app.
                             2) run command python app.py 
                             3) While running the app for the first time, google OAuth flow needs to be completed. A google sign in page will open where you should sign in with google account from which the project is created. A page with message ‘Authentication flow completed’ will be shown.
                             4) This is one time activity as long as newly generated Oauth credentials are stored on the system
                            5) In the browser address bar enter localhost:5000 , and app’s home page will appear.
                            6) For any subsequent web app usages, just use command python app.py in root directory.
                            7) Make sure the app is not already running before starting it. If it is, you will need to manually kill that process using commands like:
                                 ps -ef | grep python                                       and after locating pid of app.py process,
                                 kill -SIGKILL pid

	
	
    5.  Laptop Specifications needed:
                Laptop with RAM greater than equal to 8 GB is preferred due to execution time.
    6. Softwares needed:
               Any IDE such as VS Studio code will make running the app a pleasing experience.
